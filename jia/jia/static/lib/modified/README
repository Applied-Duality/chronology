https://github.com/ngyewch/angular-rickshaw @ 9358ccd61bb2c6aae5e040db33bdd08932602adb
was modified to support automatic debounced redrawing of Rickshaw charts on
window resize.

A dependency to Underscore.js was added since Jia depends on it anyway. This
is okay, because the changes here are not generally applicable enough to be
pull-requested.
