https://github.com/ngyewch/angular-rickshaw @ 9358ccd61bb2c6aae5e040db33bdd08932602adb
was modified to support automatic debounced redrawing of Rickshaw charts on
window resize.

A dependency to Underscore.js was added since Jia depends on it anyway. This
is okay, because the changes here are not generally applicable enough to be
pull-requested.

-------------------
Whatever version of rickshaw.min.js that was already in the repository was
modified to make the points look nicer when you hover over them. By default,
the border color on the div is the series color and the background of the div
is just white (not visible). It was modified so that the background of the div
is the series color and the border color is the series color with a little
transparency in the alpha channel. This allows for the radius of the point to
be turned up with CSS, showing the series color as a solid point with a
lareger semi-transparent radius surrounding it. It was such an easy change, I
typed it directly into the minified JS file, so I imagine it will not be
difficult to maintain in the future.
